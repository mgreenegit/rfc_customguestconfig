This repository is a design feedback solution for Azure Policy Guest Configuration
to support customer-provided content.
As part of an open collaboration with the community
we welcome you to review the information on this page,
the project examples,
[submit pull requests to test content](#submit-your-own-example-test),
and **please provide feedback** using the survey in the
[Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/issues)
list.

## What is the scenario we would like to support

In Spring 2019,
we would like to offer support for customers to use their own content in
[Azure Policy Guest Configuration](https://aka.ms/gcpol)
scenarios.
Azure already offers built-in Policy content to audit settings
inside virtual machines such as which application are installed and/or not installed.
This change would empower customers to author
and use custom configurations.

Examples include:

- Security configuration baselines (many settings)
- Key security checks such as which accounts have administrative privileges inside VMs
- Application settings

To validate this scenario,
we would like to work together with customers to test content, openly.

An early iteration of this capability in preview supports
configurations for Windows authored in Desired State Configuration
and profiles for Linux authored in Chef Inspec.
Only resources provided in the Guest Configuration module
are recommended.

In future iterations,
custom DSC resources and 3rd party tools will also be available for testing.

### User story

Dana is responsible for virtual machines running in the Azure cloud.
She needs to be certain that for all machines,
an anti-virus solution is installed and configured correctly.
She creates a configuration with details about the solution
and publishes it to Azure blob storage.
Next, She creates new definitions in Azure Policy
to assign the content to all VMs and audit the compliance status.
Finally, She reviews the results in Azure Policy and sets up an alert
to be notified if any servers do not meet requirements.

## What we are proposing to support this scenario

For built-in policies, the
[Guest Configuration API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/guestconfiguration/guestconfigurationassignments/get#guestconfigurationnavigation)
accepts a GET operation that returns properties
including a contentURI path to the configuration package
and contentHash value so the content can be verified.
As a solution to support custom content,
we also allow a PUT operation to set properties
for the location and hash value.
This means the content package can be hosted in locations
such GitHub, cloud storage,
or static links to NuGet feeds such as the
[Artifact service in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/pipeline-artifacts?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).

We also believe there is a need for additional tooling
to simplify the process of authoring configuration content.
New cmdlets in the
[Guest Configuration module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/GuestConfiguration/)
are available to provide assistance for content authors.
This includes validation, packaging, and publishing, including helping you to produce and publish
Azure Policy definitions.

Many organizations need to audit servers against configuration baselines
published by third party organizations.
A community module,
[Baseline Management](https://github.com/microsoft/baselinemanagement)
provides a solution to convert from Group Policy templates to DSC configurations,
which can be used directly in Azure to audit settings in virtual machines.

## Live example build repo

This repo demonstrates how a project
to centrally manage a custom policy
might be organized.

Folders in this repo and their purpose:

| Folder | Purpose
|-|-
|[deploymentFiles](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/tree/master/deploymentFiles)|Contains Azure Resource Manager deployment templates for creating requirements including a storage container for the private configuration content package and Azure Policy assignments
|[policyFiles](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/tree/master/policyFiles)|Contains Azure Policy definitions generated by the New-GuestConfigurationPolicy cmdlet
|[guestConfiguration](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/tree/master/guestConfiguration)|Contains example PowerShell scripts to generate Guest Configuration MOF files to be used by Azure Policy, as well as an InSpec profile for Linux.

The
[deployIfNotExists](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/blob/master/policyFiles/Linux/deployIfNotExists.json)
files for each operating system are refreshed during each build
including the
[hash value](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/blob/master/policyFiles/Linux/deployIfNotExists.json#L210)
of the content package.

Parameter values are expressed as PowerShell
[hashtables](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml#L173)
in the YAML build script.
These could be moved to data files if preferred.

### Submit your own example test

If you would like to test your own content, there are two options available.

- Fork this repo and connect Azure DevOps to your project.
  This will require you to setup a new project in Azure DevOps with a service connection named 'ARM'
  and a variable group connected to Azure KeyVault.  A step by step guid to creating a content
  package using the Guest Configuration cmdlets is published in the
  [docs folder](https://github.com/Microsoft/rfc_customguestconfig/blob/master/docs/draft.md).
  Feedback on this draft documentation is greatly appreciated.
- Submit a PR.  Although incoming pull requests will not trigger new builds automatically,
  we will review your code and manually trigger a build to test your content for you,
  and follow up in the PR conversation.

## Give us feedback

We are very interested in understanding how you would leverage
Azure Guest Configuration to audit settings
inside your virtual machines.
Please contribute to the Issues list with ideas for content
that could be validated in this RFC repo,
and any requirements you have for tools that improve your authoring experience.
